    The hashing algorithm for the resource attributes cache in the Gnocchi
    publisher has been changed to BLAKE2 to provide a deterministic and low
    collision risk hash that is stable between processes, hosts and restarts.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default hashing for the resource attributes cache in the Gnocchi publisher
    has been changed from the builtin Python hash function to using the BLAKE2
    algorithm, this will cause the cache for attributes for Gnocchi resources
    to be rebuild that can cause a temporary higher load on the Gnocchi API due
    to more resource update requests.
