features:
  - |
    When ``[polling]/ignore_disabled_projects`` is enabled, project filtering
    is now performed server-side using API filters. This improves the
    performance of project discovery (used by the Swift object storage pollsters),
    particularly when Keystone has a lot of disabled projects (e.g. retained for
    record-keeping purposes, since deleting projects in Keystone removes them
    completely).
upgrade:
  - |
    When ``[polling]/ignore_disabled_projects`` is enabled, projects that are
    part of disabled domains are also ignored, regardless of whether or not
    the projects inside those domains are marked as disabled.
