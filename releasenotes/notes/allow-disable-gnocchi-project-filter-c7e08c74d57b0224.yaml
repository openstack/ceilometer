    Filtering out metrics from the Gnocchi service project in the Gnocchi
    publisher can now be disabled using the ``enable_filter_project``
    publisher option, e.g. ``gnocchi://?enable_filter_project=false``
    (``true`` by default). This ensures that the Gnocchi service project
    always has metrics published to Gnocchi itself, which is usually the
    desired behaviour when the Swift storage driver is not being used
    (filtering should be **enabled** when using the Swift storage driver,
    to eliminate feedback loops during metric generation).
