    The ``network.services.firewall`` pollster now publishes samples for all
    found firewalls, even if they are known to have an unknown state, when
    they would previously be dropped. The volume of samples for such firewalls
    will be set to ``-1``. This improves visibility of firewalls with unknown
    states, allowing them to be monitored via samples and the
    Gnocchi/Prometheus metrics, making it easier to discover such resources
    for troubleshooting. It also moves some of the "business logic" for
    downstream rating/billing services such as CloudKitty out of Ceilometer
    itself.
