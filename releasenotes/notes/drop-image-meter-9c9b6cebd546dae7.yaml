prelude: >
    In an effort to minimise the noise, Ceilometer will no longer produce
    meters which have no measurable data associated with it. Image meter
    only captures state information which is already captured in events and
    other meters.
upgrade:
  - Any existing commands utilising `image` meter should be switched to
    `image.size` meter which will provide equivalent functionality
deprecations:
  - The `image` meter is dropped in favour of `image.size` meter.
