    Add Designate DNS zone metrics polling support. This includes a new
    dns_zone resource type for Gnocchi and the following meters:
    ``dns.zone.status`` (zone status as numeric value),
    ``dns.zone.recordsets`` (number of recordsets in a zone),
    ``dns.zone.ttl`` (zone TTL value), and
    ``dns.zone.serial`` (zone serial number).
    A new discovery plugin ``dns_zones`` is also added to discover
    DNS zones from Designate across all projects.
